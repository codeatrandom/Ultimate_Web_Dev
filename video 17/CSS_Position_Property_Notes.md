# CSS Position Property (Notes)

CSS positioning is about **controlling the placement of elements within a web page**.  
With CSS positioning, you can **override the normal document flow** and decide exactly where an element should appear.

The `position` property specifies the positioning type for an element.  
It can have one of the following values:

- **static** â†’ Default positioning (elements appear in normal flow)  
- **relative** â†’ Moves element relative to its original position  
- **absolute** â†’ Positions element relative to the nearest positioned ancestor  
- **fixed** â†’ Stays fixed relative to the viewport, even when scrolling  
- **sticky** â†’ Behaves like relative until a scroll threshold is reached, then sticks in place

## ðŸŽ“ Real-Life Analogy (Classroom Example)

Think of a **classroom**:  

- **static** â†’ All students sit in their assigned seats (default).  
- **relative** â†’ One student shifts their chair slightly but their seat is still reserved.  
- **absolute** â†’ A student ignores their row and sits on the teacherâ€™s desk.  
- **fixed** â†’ A notice stuck on the whiteboard â€” it stays there even if you move around.  
- **sticky** â†’ A studentâ€™s name card that only sticks to the top of the board once you scroll down to that row.

## ðŸ“Œ Summary
- Use **static** for normal flow.  
- Use **relative** when you want small adjustments while keeping space reserved.  
- Use **absolute** when placing elements inside a container.  
- Use **fixed** for elements that should stay in place while scrolling.  
- Use **sticky** for headers/navbars that stick only when scrolled to a certain point.
